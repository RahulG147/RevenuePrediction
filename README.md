# RevenuePrediction
Using logs of various customers and the purchasing history a model has been developed which is used to analyse the behaviour of every customer also used to predict revenue generating customers. 
The model developed can identify all types of customer for better analysis of the behaviour. 
From the experimental results, it has been found out that Light GBM algorithm predicts the revenue generating customer with the help of feature importance developed on the basis of RFM analysis result and RFM scores. 
The result of LightGBM algorithm is with the validation score of 1.70 and accuracy of 80.147%. 
The performance of Light GBM algorithm can be improved with more accurate dataset along with modifications in the algorithm. Using this model an organization can easily make decisions about various customers.

The dataset for the given project are very huge as there are over 9lakh customers whose analysis has been done. Those datasets which were very small has been uploaded in the repo. 
Rest of the dataset can be downloaded from the below links. Do not forget to change the directory of the data in the code as per the location of the data in your system.
